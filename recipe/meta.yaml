  summary: Use Twisted anywhere!
  description: |
    Crochet is an MIT-licensed library that makes it easier to use Twisted from
    regular blocking code. Some use cases include:

      * Easily use Twisted from a blocking framework like Django or Flask.

      * Write a library that provides a blocking API, but uses Twisted for its
        implementation.

      * Port blocking code to Twisted more easily, by keeping a backwards
        compatibility layer.

      * Allow normal Twisted programs that use threads to interact with Twisted
        more cleanly from their threaded parts. For example, this can be useful
        when using Twisted as a WSGI container.
